            <p> <img src="assets/images/my-pic.JPG" alt="Shavkat Metekov" style="width: 182.594px; height:300px; margin-right:15px;"></p>
            <p>I am from Turkmenistan, Central Asia. 
                Two years ago graduated Metropolitan State University with BAS in Computer Forensics. I like troubleshooting computer issues so I enjoy my work for the most part
                I also love nature and looking for bugs. That is why I decided I will work with code and possibly get into developing positions at my work. If you are curious, 
                I have seen snow before I came to Minnesota. Actually, we get cold temperature close to Minnesotan. However, extreme cold is colder in Minnesota and winter here is longer which makes it worse.

                I have been working with computers for a several years now. Mostly I do troubleshooting on different levels. Starting from "Have you tried turning it on and off" to
                "What server are you trying to connect to?" I starting liking coding when I saw the show Mr Robot. Although he is not a programmer per se, but there are some things 
                shown in that show that "trigger that portion of my brain."
